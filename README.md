# Inventory-Managment-System

<p>Inventory management system is a JavaFx project that was degined to keep track of products and their associated parts. With this program one would be able to quiqly lookup parts and pruducts, view quantity, and detrimine if they are outsourced or in-house. Also, this software allows for adding or deleting products to the inventory. This  program was designed to look clean and insure data integrity

* Add Part 
<p> The user has the option to select “In-House” or “Outsourced” to categorize the part.  If the user selects “Outsourced,” the “Company Name” field is available.
The field “Inv” stores the number of units of the product that the company currently have available. The field “Min” stores the requirement for the minimum number of product items that must be available by the company at any given moment in time, and the field “Max” denotes the maximum number of product items that the company can store. The values of the filed “Inv,” therefore, must be an integer between the values stored in the field “Min” and “Max.” 
If the user selects “In-House,” the “Machine ID” field is available.
